# SimpleBluetoothTerminal

This Android app provides a line-oriented terminal / console for classic Bluetooth (2.x) devices implementing the Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP)

For an overview on Android Bluetooth communication see 
[Android Bluetooth Overview](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth).

This App implements RFCOMM connection to the well-known SPP UUID 00001101-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB

## Motivation

I got various requests asking for help with Android development or source code for my 
[Serial Bluetooth Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal) app.
Here you find a simplified version of my app.
